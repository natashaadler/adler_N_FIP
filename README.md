# Mikito - Portfolio Website
### Final Integrated Project

*October 18, 2020*


Mikito derives from the spanish translation of "Monkey". Monkey is my nickname given to me by my significant other. It signifys a playfulness whilst remaining intune to ones design desires through the large ears. My site embodys everything about me, including my attention to detail, conceptual design and various art forms and expressions.
